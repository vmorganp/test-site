A quick calculator I tossed together to calculate speed drop

## What is speed drop?

The youtube channel "Mountains, Mullets, Merica" has a good video about it [here](https://youtu.be/9zC-pNJwBwA)

Essentially, it allows you to use a MIL/MRAD reticle as a BDC such that every mil is 100 yards, for a given range window.
This calculator will only calculate the _maximum window_ which may not be what you want. If you want something more centered around a longer range, you'll have to work that out yourself
